                <p>
                    I want to use this paragraph to "thank" the candy
                    companies for changing "King-sized" to "Sharing Size."

                    It felt good to eat like a "king," now I just feel shame
                    for being selfish AND fat. I'm also not sure why some candy bars
                    have decided that they need to print instructions for opening their products.
                    I'm sure it had something to do with a customer trying to open a candybar
                    with a chainsaw and when they complained to the company about destroying all the candy
                    when they tried to open it their way... The company was reasponsible for not having the
                    specific opening instructions.

                <p style="text-align:left;">I had a really strange experience a few months ago...
                   I went into a place called DeMay Furs on Cherokee St(Antique Row).
                   As I walked in, I was greeted(?) with nothing but a cold stare from a woman I assume was the owner. As a dog ran up and started sniffing me,
                   I said "Hello!" hoping to get some kind of reaction or proper greeting... nothing.
                   Just kept staring at me. I finally got her to say something when I asked her dogs name.
                   Then a man came out from the back who was a tad bit friendlier.
                   Asked me if I knew what the weather was going to be like for the day.
                   I think it was supposed to snow and I told him that.
                   He got really excited and said "I'm from California!" That's it. No follow up statement... just "I'm from California!"
                   This man also had a giant bloody booger hanging from his nose.
                   I began to explain that I heard Antique Row was something I should check out and their store was the first I stopped in.
                   He was like "We mainly do furs, you should go to *name of place I forgot*. Where's *name of other dog I didn't know existed*?! Have you seen him?!"
                   Then he runs outside calling the dogs name, the lady starts SCREAMING the other dogs name, he comes back in and starts SCREAMING!
                   Finally, all I can think is they're going to accuse me of letting out a dog a never saw or this is an elaborate scheme to get me out of their store so I decide to leave.
                   If you ever want to experience what it might be like to live in an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ch1kXp3mQA" target="_blank">Portlandia</a>, check out <a href ="http://demayfurs.com/" target="_blank">DeMay Furs</a> on Cherokee.

               <h2>Space</h2>
               <p style="text -align:left;">I don't really have anything to say here.
                    I'm pretty terrible at coming up with things to say. It takes me 30 minutes to think of the right way to respond to a text sometimes. So, sorry if I didn't take this as serious as I should have. I just don't have enough time think up a 10 paragraph story. 
                     I'm am pretty excited to share this photo though.</p>
