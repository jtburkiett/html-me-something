                    I want to start this section out by <i>thanking</i> the candy
                    companies for changing "King-sized" to "Sharing Size." <i>THANKS, CANDY COMPANIES.</i>
                </p>

                    It felt good to eat like a "king," now I just feel shame
                    for being selfish AND fat. I'm also not sure why some candy bars
                    have decided that they need to print instructions for opening their products right on the packaging.

                    I'm sure it had something to do with a customer trying to open a candybar
                    with a chainsaw and then complaining to the company about destroying all the candy
                    trying to open it their dumb way, making the company reasponsible for not having
                    specific opening instructions.

                <p style=>I had a really strange experience a few months ago...
                   I went into a place called DeMay Furs on Cherokee Antique Row.
                   As I walked in, I was greeted(?) with nothing but a cold stare from a woman I assume was the owner. As a dog ran up and started sniffing me,
                   I said "Hello!" hoping to get some kind of reaction or proper greeting... nothing.
                   Just kept staring at me. I finally got her to say something when I asked her dogs name.
                   Then a man came out from the back who was a tad bit friendlier.
                   Asked me if I knew what the weather was going to be like for the day.
                   I think it was supposed to snow and I told him that.
                   He got really excited and said "I'm from California!" That's it. No follow up statement... just "I'm from California!"
                   This man also had a giant bloody booger hanging from his nose.
                   I began to explain that I heard Antique Row was something I should check out and their store was the first I stopped in.
                   He was like "We mainly do furs, you should go to *name of place I forgot*. Where's *name of other dog I didn't know existed*?! Have you seen him?!"
                   Then he runs outside calling the dogs name, the lady starts SCREAMING the other dogs name, he comes back in and starts SCREAMING!
                   Finally, all I can think is they're going to accuse me of letting out a dog a never saw or this is an elaborate scheme to get me out of their store so I decide to leave.

               <h2>Space</h2>
               <p>I don't really have anything to say here.
                    I'm pretty terrible at coming up with things to say. It takes me 30 minutes to think of the right way to respond to a text sometimes.  I have ADHD, in case you couldn't tell, and I'm not medicated because it's not life threatening and my insurance sucks.
                     I'm am pretty excited to share this photo though. Yes, that is my young, disembodied head floating in space</p>
